//PROBLEM STATEMENT: Design a program with the following functionalities:
1. A function to read two numbers(Double type)
2. A function to calculate division of these two numbers
3. A try block to detect and throw an exception when divide by zero condition occurs
4. Appropriate catch block to handle the exception thrown

CODE
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
    double num1, num2, result;

    cout << "Enter first number: ";
    cin >> num1;
    cout << "Enter second number: ";
    cin >> num2;

    try {
        if (num2 == 0) {
            throw 0;
        }
        result = num1 / num2;
        cout << "Result = " << result << endl;
    }
    catch (int) {
        cout << "Error: Division by zero!" << endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
